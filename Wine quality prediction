```{r setup, include = FALSE}
options(scipen=999)

packages <- c('papaja', 'knitr', 'citr', 'car','mlogit','readr','Amelia','caTools', 'dplyr', 'rpart', 'mlogit', 'nnet', 'ggplot2', 'caret', 'MASS', 'corrplot', 'gridExtra', 'randomForest', 'tidyverse', 'broom')

for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p,character.only = TRUE)) install.packages(p, dependencies = TRUE)
  suppressMessages(library(p,character.only = TRUE, quietly = TRUE))

```


```{r wordcount, echo=FALSE}

```


```{r analysis-preferences, echo= FALSE}
# Seed for random number generation
set.seed(100)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache.extra = knitr::rand_seed)
```

We start by loading the required packages and the red wine and white wine quality dataset.
```{r loadData, echo=FALSE}
red<-read.csv("..../Project/winequality-red.csv",sep=";", header=TRUE)
white <- read.csv("..../Project/winequality-white.csv",sep=";", header=TRUE)
```

# Checking for NA

Checking for missing values. There are no NA in either dataset.
```{r missingvalues, echo=FALSE}
apply(red, 2, function(x) any(is.na(x)))
apply(white, 2, function(x) any(is.na(x)))
```

# Exploratory analysis

Doing some initial exploratory analysis. Most of the observation fallin the category 5 and 6 quality.
```{r exploranalysis, echo=FALSE}
head(red)
str(red)
summary(red)
table(red$quality)
head(white)
str(white)
summary(white)
table(white$quality)
```

# Data visualiztaion

Data visualization to see the trend in the dataset. The graphs show imbalance in the dataset. Most of the data is skewed to the left.
```{r datavizualization, echo = FALSE}
r1 <- ggplot(red, aes(x=fixed.acidity,fill=as.factor(quality)))+
  geom_histogram(bins=25,col='black',alpha=0.3)

r2<- ggplot(red, aes(x=total.sulfur.dioxide,fill=as.factor(quality)))+
  geom_histogram(bins=25, col='black',alpha=0.3)

r3<- ggplot(red, aes(x=alcohol,fill=as.factor(quality)))+
  geom_histogram(bins=25, col='black',alpha=0.3)

r4 <- ggplot(red, aes(x=pH,fill=as.factor(quality)))+

grid.arrange(r1,r2,r3,r4,r5, nrow=3)
grid.arrange(w1,w2,w3,w4,w5, nrow=3)
```

# Checking for outliers

Checking for any outliers in the dataset. 
+ Maximum number of highvalues fallin in wine quality '5' and '6'. But we cannot assume that those are outliers.
+ Mean of alcohol, sulphates, volatile acidity, total sulpfur dioxide and density looks significantly different from each other for wine quality '5' and '6' and hence they could be significant variable to determine quality of the wine.
```{r checkoutliers, echo= FALSE}
red_out <- list()
col_names <- colnames(red[,1:11])
for(names in col_names){
    red_out[[names]] <- ggplot(red[c(names,'quality')], aes(as.factor(quality),red[[names]])) +
                geom_boxplot() + ylab(names) + xlab('Quality') 
    print(red_out[[names]])
}

white_out <- list()
col_names <- colnames(white[,1:11])
for(names in col_names){
    white_out[[names]] <- ggplot(white[c(names,'quality')], aes(as.factor(quality),white[[names]])) +
                geom_boxplot() + ylab(names) + xlab('Quality') 
    print(white_out[[names]])
}
```

# Classifying the quality of wines

We create a rating column. For red wine:
+ Quality rating > 6 : Wine is "Good"
+ Quality rating <=6 : Wine is "Not good"

For white wine:
+ Quality rating > 7 : wine is "Good"
+ Quality rating <=7 : wine is "Not good"
```{r classification, echo=FALSE}
red$rating <- ifelse(as.integer(red$quality) >6,1,0)
white$rating <- ifelse(as.integer(white$quality) > 7,1,0)
table(red$rating)
table(white$rating)
```


# Correlation 

Finding correlation in the data and from the output we can see that none of the variables are correlated with the quality variable.
```{r correlation, echo = FALSE}
red_corr <- data.frame(cor(red))
print(cbind(colnames(red),round(red_corr$quality, 4)))

white_corr <- data.frame(cor(white))
print(cbind(colnames(red),round(white_corr$quality, 4)))
```


# Splitting the data on quality

Splitting the data into train dataset and test dataset with a split ratio of .70.
```{r splittingdata, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(3000)
sample_red <- sample.split(red$quality, SplitRatio = .70)
red_train <- subset(red, sample_red == TRUE)
red_test <- subset(red, sample_red == FALSE)

sample_white <- sample.split(white$quality, SplitRatio = .70)
white_train <- subset(white, sample_white == TRUE)
white_test <- subset(white, sample_white == FALSE)
```

# Distance

```{r distance, echo=FALSE}
red_dist <- data.frame(table(red$quality))
red_train_dist <- data.frame(table(red_train$quality))
red_test_dist <- data.frame(table(red_test$quality))
red_class_dist <- cbind(red_dist, red_train_dist[2], red_test_dist[2])
red_class_dist

white_dist <- data.frame(table(white$quality))
white_train_dist <- data.frame(table(white_train$quality))
white_test_dist <- data.frame(table(white_test$quality))
white_class_dist <- cbind(white_dist, white_train_dist[2], white_test_dist[2])
white_class_dist
```


# Correlation plotting

Checking for correlation among significant variables.
+ For red wine acidic variables are correlated with each other and also with pH and density. 
+ For white wine quality is moderately correlated with alcohol, alcohol is moderately correlated with the density of wine apart from being moderaltely correlated with quality, density is strongly correlated with residual sugar quantity and moderately correlated with pH and free sulfur dioxide and total sulfur dioxide are strongly correlated
```{r correlationplot, echo=FALSE}
R <- cor(red)
corrplot(R, method = "number")

W <- cor(white)
corrplot(W, method = "number")
```


# Linear Regression

Performing linear regression. 
+ For red wine adjusted R-squared value is 0.3792 and  volatile acidity, chlorides, total sulfur dioxide, sulphates and alcohol are significant variables. 
+ Adjusted R-squared for white wine is 0.2829. Citric acid, total sulfur dioxide and chlorides are not significant. Chloride is moderately correlated with alcohol and alcohol was usually higher for better quality wines. 
+ We will remove the insignificant variables and see if that improves R-squared of our model.

```{r linearreg, echo=FALSE}
red_lm1 <- lm(quality ~ .-rating, data = red_train)
summary(red_lm1)

white_lm1 <- lm(quality ~ .-rating, data = white_train)
summary(white_lm1)
```

Removing the non-significant variables reduces the adjusted R-squared value for red wine to 0.364 and slightly improved for white wine to 0.2831.
```{r linearregression, echo=FALSE}
red_lm2 <- lm(quality ~ volatile.acidity + total.sulfur.dioxide + sulphates + alcohol, data = red_train)
summary(red_lm2)

white_lm2 <- lm(quality ~ .-citric.acid - chlorides - total.sulfur.dioxide - rating, data = white_train)
summary(white_lm2)
```

Removing fixes acidity for white wine does not improve our model and adjusted R-squared value is 0.2816 
```{r linear, echo=FALSE}
white_lm3 <- lm(quality ~ .-fixed.acidity - citric.acid - chlorides - total.sulfur.dioxide - rating , data = white_train)
summary(white_lm3)
```

The model prediction will not give an integer value so we cannot properly explain the variation in the quality. We can check the prediction made by our best model (red_lm1 and white_lm2) over testing set. For red wine it almost predicts good quality wine with value almost close to 8 but for white wine the maximum value is only 7.2, so it is not predicting any wine to be of high quality.
```{r predictquality, echo= FALSE}
redpred <- predict(red_lm1, newdata = red_test)
summary(redpred)

whitepred <- predict(white_lm2, newdata = white_test)
summary(whitepred)
```


# Splitting the data on rating

Splitting the data on the basis of rating,
```{r datasplit, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
sample_red1 <- sample.split(red$rating, SplitRatio = .70)
red_train1 <- subset(red, sample_red1 == TRUE)
red_test1 <- subset(red, sample_red1 == FALSE)

sample_white1 <- sample.split(white$rating, SplitRatio = .70)
white_train1 <- subset(white, sample_white1 == TRUE)
white_test1 <- subset(white, sample_white1 == FALSE)
```

# Data Factor

```{r factordata, echo= FALSE}
red_train1$rating <- as.factor(red_train1$rating)
red_test1$rating <- as.factor(red_test1$rating)
white_train1$rating <- as.factor(white_train1$rating)
white_test1$rating <- as.factor(white_test1$rating)
str(white_train1)
str(white_test1)
```

# Logistic regression

Building logistic regression models for red wine and white wine datasets.
```{r logregression, echo =FALSE}
red_mlg <- glm(rating ~.-quality ,data=red_train1,family = "binomial")
white_mlg <- glm(rating ~.-quality ,data=white_train1,family = "binomial")
summary(red_mlg)
summary(white_mlg)
```


Finding the error and accuracy of the model. The red wine model accuracy is 86.4% and white wine model to 75.6%
```{r Logisticmodelaccuracy, echo=FALSE}
red_prediction <- predict(red_mlg, newdata = red_test1, type = "response")
print(paste('Accuracy of red wine model is:', paste0(round(max(red_prediction),3)*100,"%")))
white_prediction <- predict(white_mlg, newdata=white_test1, type="response")
print(paste('Accuracy of white wine model is:', paste0(round(max(white_prediction),3)*100,"%")))
```

# Logistic Regression Assumptions

```{r assumptions, echo=FALSE}
# Fit the logistic regression model
red_model <- glm(rating ~. -quality, data = red, 
               family = binomial)

red_probabilities <- predict(red_model, type = "response")
red_predicted.classes <- ifelse(red_probabilities > 0.5, "pos", "neg")
head(red_predicted.classes)

white_model <- glm(rating ~. -quality, data = white, 
               family = binomial)

white_probabilities <- predict(white_model, type = "response")
white_predicted.classes <- ifelse(white_probabilities > 0.5, "pos", "neg")
head(white_predicted.classes)
```

Linearity assumption. Taking only numeric columns from the originial data set and binding the logit values to the data and then creating a scatterplot. 
+ For red wine citric.acid, density and quality have a smooth scatter plot. 
+ For white wine alcohol, chlorides and quality have a smooth scatter plot.
```{r linearity assumption, echo= FALSE}
reddata <- red %>%
  dplyr::select_if(is.numeric) 
red_predictors <- colnames(reddata)
# Bind the logit and tidying the data for plot
reddata <- reddata %>%
  mutate(red_logit = log(red_probabilities/(1-red_probabilities))) %>%
  gather(key = "red_predictors", value = "predictor.value", -red_logit)

theme_set(theme_classic())

ggplot(reddata, aes(red_logit, predictor.value))+
  geom_point(size = 0.5, alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  facet_wrap(~red_predictors, scales = "free_y")

whitedata <- white %>%
  dplyr::select_if(is.numeric) 
white_predictors <- colnames(whitedata)
# Bind the logit and tidying the data for plot
whitedata <- whitedata %>%
  mutate(white_logit = log(white_probabilities/(1-white_probabilities))) %>%
  gather(key = "white_predictors", value = "predictor.value", -white_logit)

theme_set(theme_classic())

ggplot(whitedata, aes(white_logit, predictor.value))+

  geom_smooth(method = "loess") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  facet_wrap(~white_predictors, scales = "free_y")
```

```

+ The accuracy rate of random forest model for red wine is (410+34)/480 = 92.5%.
+ The accuracy rate of random forest model for white wine is (1414+17)/1469 = 97.4%.
